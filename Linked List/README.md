Time Complexity Analysis

Initializing the list: This takes O(1) time because only one node is created in memory.

Inserting/deleting: This takes O(n) time because each element must be traversed until the insertion index is reached. Worst case, the entire length of the list must be traversed.

Inserting/deleting at beginning: This takes O(1) time because there is no traversal through the list.

Get At/Set At: This also takes O(n) time because the list must be traversed.

Print List: This takes O(n) time because every element is traversed and printed out.

Average overall time complexity: O(n)
